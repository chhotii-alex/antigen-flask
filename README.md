# antigen-flask

This is the back end of the COVIRAL webapp (not including the database).

See https://github.com/chhotii-alex/antigen-sensitivity for the front-end webapp which consumes the API
exported by this Flask app.

This is set up to deploy on Digital Ocean's App Platform, using Werkzeug and gunicorn.
